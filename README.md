# Easy-Ask
Whatâ€™s a simple online task that someone can do to improve your day?

## General info
What do you do if you're looking for something to be done by a group of people, but you don't have an audience of your own?

Maybe you just posted your first blog article and you want some feedback. Perhaps you're a fourth year psych student looking for research participants for an online survey for your thesis. Or maybe you've just built a new app and you want people to give it a try. As someone who's been in all of these situations, but isn't keen on building up a personal audience, I wanted to come up with a solution for finding an audience without the need to maintain an audience.

And my solution was Easy Asks.
